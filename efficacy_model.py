# between actions to WORK which has an immediate effort cost and SHIRK which has an immediate reward. 
# The final state is absorbing and also has a reward (equivalent to rewards from shirk). The outcome from evaluation 
# only comes at the deadline (which can be negative to positive based on state at final timepoint).
