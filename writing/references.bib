Hence, the relevant conceptual, theoretical, and empirical work is reviewed, drawing upon correlational, experimental, and qualitative findings. A meta-analysis of procrastination's possible causes and effects, based on 691 correlations, reveals that neuroticism, rebelliousness, and sensation seeking show only a weak connection. Strong and consistent predictors of procrastination were task aversiveness, task delay, self-efficacy, and impulsiveness, as well as conscientiousness and its facets of self-control, distractibility, organization, and achievement motivation. These effects prove consistent with temporal motivation theory, an integrative hybrid of expectancy theory and hyperbolic discounting. Continued research into procrastination should not be delayed, especially because its prevalence appears to be growing.},

We examine this dynamic phenomenon in a detailed and realistic longitudinal design (Study 1) as well as in a large correlational data set (N = 7400; Study 2). The results are largely consistent with temporal motivation theory. People’s pacing style reflects a hyperbolic curve, with the steepness of the curve predicted by self-reported procrastination. Procrastination is related to intention-action gaps, but not intentions. Procrastinators are susceptible to proximity of temptation and to the temporal separation between their intention and the planned act; the more distal, the greater the gap. Critical self-regulatory skills in explaining procrastination are attention control, energy regulation and automaticity, accounting for 74\% of the variance. Future research using this design is recommended, as it provides an almost ideal blend of realism and detailed longitudinal assessment.},

	abstract = {Procrastination is prevalent in people’s daily lives. Empirical studies of procrastination have identiﬁed various contributing factors, including temporal discounting, perfectionism, and time pressure. Models of procrastination, however, have only considered temporal discounting and have ignored other factors. Also, they assume that people make a binary choice between working and delaying, which ignores the fact that people often also decide the amount of effort they put into their work. We bridge this gap by using reinforcement learning theory to re-examine procrastination. Our model predicts two scenarios in which a rational agent chooses to procrastinate: one is that people delay working until the last minute if their cost is sensitive to increases in effort when it is low, and another is that people do not work at all if they pursue perfection under time pressure. Our model raises questions about the common notion that procrastination is necessarily irrational, and suggests several experimental tests.},

Procrastination is believed to be associated with several cognitive, behavioral, and affective correlates and is regarded as a “dysfunction of important human abilities” in routine tasks and critical life tasks (Milgram, Sroloff, \& Rosenbaum, 1988, p. 210). The extent of the dysfunction is reflected by estimates indicating that at least 25\% of students suffer from severe levels of procrastination (see Hill, Hill, Chabot, \& Barrall, 1978; McCown, Johnson, \& Petzel, 1989b). Given the potential importance of the procrastination construct, it is perhaps not surprising that it is a topic that has been discussed at length by clinicians and by counselors (e.g., Burka \& Yuen, 1983; Ellis \& Knaus, 1977; Rarer, 1983).},

Still, there is debate about what exactly procrastination is and how it should be operationalized. The fields of neuroscience and behavioral economics point to procrastination as an irrational delay, where we put off despite being worse off. A competing tripartite model has divided procrastination into avoidance, arousal, and decisional. The validity of the avoidance, arousal and decisional model is reviewed here, first meta-analytically and then factor analytically, using a large sample exceeding 4000 respondents. The evidence does not support the tripartite model, particularly the avoidant and arousal distinction, instead indicating that procrastination is indeed an irrational delay. A new scale consistent with this conceptualization, the Pure Procrastination Scale, is derived from the factor analysis, showing improved correlations with key constructs, such as SWB. This new scale provides the field of procrastination with an improved measurement base, likely increasing the usefulness of our future findings.},

In this paper, we argue that as a form of self-regulation failure, procrastination has a great deal to do with short-term mood repair and emotion regulation. Moreover, we contend that a temporal understanding of self and the mood-regulating processes involved in goal pursuit is particularly important in understanding procrastination, because the consequences of procrastination are typically borne by the future self. After summarizing the research on the priority of short-term mood regulation in procrastination, we then draw the connection between the focus on short-term mood repair and the temporal disjunction between present and future selves. We present research that exemplifies these intra-personal processes in understanding temporal notions of self characterized by procrastination, and then link these processes to the negative consequences of procrastination for health and well-being. We conclude with a discussion of possible avenues for future research to provide further insights into how temporal views of the self are linked to the dynamics of mood regulation over time in the context of procrastination.},

	abstract = {Procrastination, the voluntary and irrational delay of an intended course of action, has troubled individuals and society extensively. Various studies have been conducted to explain why people procrastinate and to explore the neural substrates of procrastination. First, research has identified many contributing factors to procrastination. Specifically, task aversiveness, future incentives, and time delay of these incentives have been confirmed as three prominent task characteristics that affect procrastination. On the other hand, self-control and impulsivity have been identified as two most predictive traits of procrastination. After identifying contributing factors, two important theories proposed to explain procrastination by integrating these factors are reviewed. Specifically, an emotion-regulation perspective regards procrastination as a form of self-regulation failure that reflects giving priority to short-term mood repair over achieving long-term goals. However, temporal motivation theory explains why people's motivation to act increases when time approaches a deadline with time discounting effect. To further specify the cognitive mechanism underlying procrastination, this study proposes a novel theoretical model which clarifies how the motivation to act and the motivation to avoid vary differently when delaying a task, explaining why people decide not to act now but are willing to act in the future. Of note, few recent studies have investigated neural correlates of procrastination. Specifically, it was revealed that individual differences in procrastination are correlated with structural abnormalities and altered spontaneous metabolism in the parahippocampal cortex and the prefrontal cortex, which might contribute to procrastination through episodic future thinking or memory and emotion regulation, respectively.

	abstract = {Procrastination is the voluntary but irrational postponing of a task despite being aware that the delay can lead to worse consequences. It has been extensively studied in psychological field, from contributing factors, to theoretical models. From value-based decision making and reinforcement learning (RL) perspective, procrastination has been suggested to be caused by non-optimal choice resulting from cognitive limitations. Exactly what sort of cognitive limitations are involved, however, remains elusive. In the current study, we examined if a particular type of cognitive limitation, namely, inaccurate valuation resulting from inadequate state representation, would cause procrastination. Recent work has suggested that humans may adopt a particular type of state representation called the successor representation (SR) and that humans can learn to represent states by relatively low-dimensional features. Combining these suggestions, we assumed a dimension-reduced version of SR. We modeled a series of behaviors of a “student” doing assignments during the school term, when putting off doing the assignments (i.e., procrastination) is not allowed, and during the vacation, when whether to procrastinate or not can be freely chosen. We assumed that the “student” had acquired a rigid reduced SR of each state, corresponding to each step in completing an assignment, under the policy without procrastination. The “student” learned the approximated value of each state which was computed as a linear function of features of the states in the rigid reduced SR, through temporal-difference (TD) learning. During the vacation, the “student” made decisions at each time-step whether to procrastinate based on these approximated values. Simulation results showed that the reduced SR-based RL model generated procrastination behavior, which worsened across episodes. According to the values approximated by the “student,” to procrastinate was the better choice, whereas not to procrastinate was mostly better according to the true values. Thus, the current model generated procrastination behavior caused by inaccurate value approximation, which resulted from the adoption of the reduced SR as state representation. These findings indicate that the reduced SR, or more generally, the dimension reduction in state representation, can be a potential form of cognitive limitation that leads to procrastination.},

Procrastination is often a consequence of people’s propensity to prioritize their immediate experiences over the long-term consequences of their actions. This suggests that aligning immediate rewards with long-term values could be a promising way to help people make more future-minded decisions and overcome procrastination. Here we develop an approach to decision support that leverages artificial intelligence and game elements to restructure challenging sequential decision problems in such a way that it becomes easier for people to take the right course of action. A series of four increasingly realistic experiments suggests that this approach can enable people to make better decisions faster, procrastinate less, complete their work on time and waste less time on unimportant tasks. These findings suggest that our method is a promising step towards developing cognitive prostheses that help people achieve their goals.},

	abstract = {When humans procrastinate, they delay completing a required relatively aversive task. In the present experiments with pigeons, we considered the possibility that completing the task close to the deadline results in the formation of a stronger conditioned reinforcer. In Experiment 1, pigeons were given a choice between two chains: (a) a signaled long period, followed by a dark gap, followed by a signaled short conditioned reinforcer, and food and (b) a signaled short period, followed by a dark gap, followed by a signaled long conditioned reinforcer, and food. We found a reliable preference for the delayed gap. In Experiment 2, we let pigeons choose between two chains: (a) walking to a near panel to peck a key, followed by a long walk to peck a key for reinforcement and (b) walking to a far panel to peck a key followed by a short walk to peck a key for reinforcement. When a single peck was required to either key, the pigeons were indifferent. When ten pecks were required to the near key but only one peck to the far key, the pigeons preferred the far key. When ten pecks were required to either key, the pigeons preferred the far key. The results of both experiments suggest that pigeons prefer to defer a relatively aversive event but, in keeping with Fantino’s Delay Reduction Theory, this effect may result from the development of a strong conditioner reinforcer that occurs when the event (the gap or required pecking) comes close to reinforcement.},

	abstract = {Two experiments studied the phenomenon of procrastination, in which pigeons chose a larger, more delayed response requirement over a smaller, more immediate response requirement. The response requirements were fixed-interval schedules that did not lead to an immediate food reinforcer, but that interrupted a 55-s period in which food was delivered at random times. The experiments used an adjusting-delay procedure in which the delay to the start of one fixed-interval requirement was varied over trials to estimate an indifference point—a delay at which the two alternatives were chosen about equally often. Experiment 1 found that as the delay to a shorter fixed-interval requirement was increased, the adjusting delay to a longer fixed-interval requirement also increased, and the rate of increase depended on the duration of the longer fixed-interval requirement. Experiment 2 found a strong preference for a fixed delay of 10 s to the start of a fixed-interval requirement compared to a mixed delay of either 0 or 20 s. The results help to distinguish among different equations that might describe the decreasing effectiveness of a response requirement with increasing delay, and they suggest that delayed reinforcers and delayed response requirements have symmetrical but opposite effects on choice.},

	abstract = {Procrastination is prevalent among students and is associated with negative outcomes, including poor academic performance and psychological distress. Research also suggests that anxiety and depression can exacerbate procrastination; however, the mechanisms associated with the development of procrastination are less understood. The current study aimed to clarify the role of negative repetitive thought (i.e., rumination and worry) in the links between anxiety and procrastination, and depression and procrastination. Ninety-one undergraduate students completed self-report measures of anxiety, depression, worry, brooding rumination, and procrastination, and two multiple mediator models were tested. Procrastination was positively correlated with the study variables, including medium effects for anxiety and depression, a large effect for rumination, and a small effect for worry. Rumination independently mediated the relationships between anxiety and procrastination, and depression and procrastination. Worry did not independently mediate these relationships. The current findings suggest rumination plays a larger role in the links between anxiety, depression, and procrastination than worry. Thus, students with higher levels of anxiety and depression engage in more negative repetitive thought, which may contribute to procrastinatory behavior as a result of a preoccupation with depressing or painful thoughts about the past.},

Since its discovery in 2014, precrastination has been demonstrated in humans and animals and has recently been revealed in an analogous tendency called the mere-urgency effect. Trying to get things done as soon as one can may reflect optimal foraging, but another less obvious factor may also contribute?reducing cognitive demands associated with having to remember what to do when. Individual differences may also play a role. Understanding precrastination will have important implications for explaining why hurrying happens as often as it does and may help reduce the chance that haste makes waste.},

	abstract = {Procrastination involves an irrational putting off of engaging in a course of action, in spite of expecting to be worse off for the delay. I suggest that to understand the processes underlying procrastination one should examine its relation to several behavioral procedures that have been studied in humans and other animals. For example, in delay discounting, smaller rewards that come sooner are often preferred over larger rewards that come later. In the context of delay discounting, procrastination can be viewed as the preference for an immediate competing activity over the delay to work on a required task. Another process similar to procrastination can be seen in free operant, temporal avoidance (or Sidman avoidance) in which an animal will receive a shock (a deadline not met) if an interval passes without a specified response (task completion). Once animals learn about the interval, they often procrastinate by waiting until the interval has almost passed before responding. Finally, research with animals suggests that the persistence of procrastination may involve a form of negative reinforcement associated with the sudden decline in anxiety or fear (relief) when the task is completed prior to the deadline. Research with animals suggests that the mechanisms responsible for human procrastination may involve systems that derive from several procedures known to produce similar behavior animals.},

	abstract = {Procrastination is the tendency to put off initiation or completion of a task. Although people are typically known to procrastinate, recent research suggests that they sometimes “pre-crastinate” by initiating a task sooner than they need to (Rosenbaum et al. in Psychological Science, 25(7), 1487–1496, 2014). A similar finding of precrastination was reported by Wasserman and Brzykcy (Psychonomic Bulletin \& Review, 22, 1130–1134, 2015) with pigeons using a somewhat different procedure. In the present experiment, we used a procedure with pigeons that was more similar to the procedure used by Rosenbaum et al. Pigeons were given a choice between two sequences of events (concurrent chains). Choice of the procrastination chain resulted in color A, which 15-s later would change to color B and 5-s later resulted in reinforcement. Choice of the precrastination chain resulted in color C, which 5-s later would change to color D and 15-s later resulted in reinforcement. Thus, both chains led to reinforcement after 20 s. Results indicated that the pigeons procrastinated. That is, they preferred the 15-5 chain over the 5-15 chain. The results are consistent with Fantino’s (Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior, 12, 723–730, 1969) delay reduction theory, which posits that stimuli that signal a reduction in the delay to reinforcement, such as the 5-s stimulus that occurred immediately prior to reinforcement, serve as strong conditioned reinforcers and should be preferred. In support of this theory, the pigeons pecked most at the 5-s stimulus that led immediately to reinforcement, indicating that it had become a strong conditioned reinforcer. The results suggest that delay reduction theory, a theory that emphasizes the attraction to stimuli that predict reinforcement with a short delay, also may contribute to human procrastination behavior because when task completion comes just before the deadline, it may become a stronger conditioned reinforcer than if task completion comes earlier.},

Here, we use fMRI during intertemporal choice to inform a computational model that predicts procrastination behavior in independent tests. Procrastination is assessed in the laboratory as the preference for performing an effortful task on the next day as opposed to immediately, and at home as the delay taken in returning completed administrative forms. These procrastination behaviors are respectively modeled as unitary and repeated decisions to postpone a task until the next time step, based on a net expected value that integrates reward and effort attributes, both discounted with delay. The key feature that is associated with procrastination behavior across individuals (both in-lab and at-home) is the extent to which the expected effort cost (signaled by the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex) is attenuated by the delay before task completion. Thus, procrastination might stem from a cognitive bias that would make doing a task later (compared to now) appear as much less effortful but not much less rewarding.},

	abstract = {Procrastination is a pervasive self-regulatory failure affecting approximately one-fifth of the adult population and half of the student population. It is defined as one’s voluntarily delay of an intended course of action despite being worse off as a result of that delay. Procrastination has a negative impact on performance and is associated with poorer mental health. Stress, worry, and feelings of guilt are common among those who procrastinate recurrently. In addition, procrastination is associated with fewer mental health-seeking behaviors and increased treatment delay, leading to greater distress and the exacerbation of illness. The current paper seeks to provide a theoretical and clinical understanding of procrastination by reviewing prior research. Procrastination can be understood using different motivational theories, learning theory, self-efficacy theory, as well as biases and heuristics. Temporal motivational theory is proposed as an integrated explanation for procrastination, consisting of the interaction of four different variables: expectancy, value, impulsiveness, and time, each of which affects the tendency to procrastinate. A general implication is that procrastination should be regarded as an idiosyncratic behavioral problem that requires a cognitive case conceptualization or a functional analysis in order to guide therapists in their work. A number of treatment interventions might be used in relation to procrastination—for example, efficacy performance spirals, automaticity, stimulus control, stimulus cues, learned industriousness, and cognitive restructuring. Furthermore, the current paper explores the evidence on using cognitive behavior therapy for procrastination, discussing the scarcity of randomized controlled trials and the lack of validated outcome measures, and highlighting the need for further research.},

	abstract = {Procrastination is prevalent and pernicious but poorly understood. Presently, there are four research deficits to be addressed. First, the definition of procrastination is uncertain, limiting the construct validity of assessments. Second, its performance effects are uncertain, with arguments indicating beneficial and detrimental outcomes. Third, treatments for procrastination are limited with many promising options relatively unexplored. Fourth, there is no widely accepted theory of procrastination. Using 217 undergraduate students taking a computerized course taught as a personalized system of instruction, this correlational study attempted to address these points.
Procrastination appears to be an intended action that is voluntarily delayed, despite expectations that this delay will fail to maximize one's utility. Since no previous procrastination indices clearly reflect this definition, new ones were developed. Several self-report and observed measures were successfully created. Reliabilities were above .80 and convergent and divergent validity was appropriate: correlating as expected with conscientiousness and its facets but not with general mental ability (GMA; as reflected in American College Test scores) and neuroticism. However, the self-report measures did appear to be contaminated by context or method effects, while the observed measure was unable to unambiguously assess rationality.
Using these measures, procrastination was a consistent predictor of performance, incremental to GMA and conscientiousness, though having both positive and negative effects. Positively, procrastinators are able to do a tremendous amount of work just before a deadline. Negatively, despite this end-productivity, overall performance was significantly impaired. Of note, the task moderates effects considerably.
Several self-regulatory skills relevant to procrastination were investigated with five notable effects. Energy Regulation, Automaticity, Temptation Attention Control, and Goal Attention Control all independently predicted procrastination, accounting for over 70\% of the variance in total. Also, Positive Goal Fantasy only had an effect in conjunction with Goal Attention Control, confirming Oettingen's (1996) “gap” effect.
Finally, the theory of picoeconomics was assessed with several supportive findings. As expected, procrastinators demonstrated an intention-action gap, procrastinating activities are related to personality traits, and proximity to temptation and impulsiveness predict procrastination. Continued research into the prediction and treatment of procrastination should not be delayed, especially since its prevalence appears to be growing.},

Factor analysis indicated that scores on Lay's (1986) scale loaded on sensation-seeking, while McCown and Johnson's (1989) scale loaded negatively with need for cognition and self-esteem variables. It would appear that although the scales assessed procrastinatory behavior, one inventory is indicative of sensation-seeking and the other the avoidance of poor self-esteem.},

	abstract = {Procrastination refers to the delay or postponement of a task or decision and is often conceptualised as a failure of self-regulation. Recent research has suggested that procrastination could be delineated into two domains: intentional and unintentional. In this two-study paper, we aimed to develop a measure of unintentional procrastination (named the Unintentional Procrastination Scale or the ‘UPS’) and test whether this would be a stronger marker of psychopathology than intentional and general procrastination. In Study 1, a community sample of 139 participants completed a questionnaire that consisted of several items pertaining to unintentional procrastination that had been derived from theory, previous research, and clinical experience. Responses were subjected to a principle components analysis and assessment of internal consistency. In Study 2, a community sample of 155 participants completed the newly developed scale, along with measures of general and intentional procrastination, metacognitions about procrastination, and negative affect. Data from the UPS were subjected to confirmatory factor analysis and revised accordingly. The UPS was then validated using correlation and regression analyses. The six-item UPS possesses construct and divergent validity and good internal consistency. The UPS appears to be a stronger marker of psychopathology than the pre-existing measures of procrastination used in this study. Results from the regression models suggest that both negative affect and metacognitions about procrastination differentiate between general, intentional, and unintentional procrastination. The UPS is brief, has good psychometric properties, and has strong associations with negative affect, suggesting it has value as a research and clinical tool.},

	isbn = {978-1-61044-365-4},
	abstract = {Many of our most urgent national problems suggest a widespread lack of concern for the future. Alarming economic conditions, such as low national savings rates, declining corporate investment in long-term capital projects, and ballooning private and public debt are matched by such social ills as diminished educational achievement, environmental degradation, and high rates of infant mortality, crime, and teenage pregnancy. At the heart of all these troubles lies an important behavioral phenomenon: in the role of consumer, manager, voter, student, or parent, many Americans choose inferior but immediate rewards over greater long-term benefits. Choice Over Time offers a rich sampling of original research on intertemporal choice—how and why people decide between immediate and delayed consequences—from a broad range of theoretical and methodological perspectives in philosophy, political science, psychology, and economics. George Loewenstein, Jon Elster, and their distinguished colleagues review existing theories and forge new approaches to understanding significant questions: Why do people seem to "discount" future benefits? Do individuals use the same decision-making strategy in all aspects of their lives? What part is played by situational factors such as the certainty of delayed consequences? How are decisions affected by personal factors such as willpower and taste? In addressing these issues, the contributors to Choice Over Time address many social, economic, psychological, and personal time problems. Their work demonstrates the predictive power of short-term preferences in behavior as varied as addiction and phobia, the effect of prices on consumption, and the dramatic rise in debt and decline in savings. Choice Over Time provides an essential source for the most recent research and theory on intertemporal choice, offering new models for time preference patterns—and their aberrations—and presenting a diversity of potential solutions to the problem of "temporal myopia."},

Previous cross-sectional studies have reported a positive association between procrastination and Internet use disorders (IUDs). Further, procrastination is included in theoretical models explaining the development of IUDs. However, little is known about the temporal relationship; thus, longitudinal studies identifying the specific predictive direction are required. Methods: Using a cross-lagged panel design, a total of 240 students who were at high risk for IUDs, aged between 12 and 18 years (M = 15.17, SD = 1.66) were assessed at baseline (t1) and reassessed one year later (t2) with standardized measures for IUDs and procrastination. Results: Our results showed that IUD symptom severity at t2 was significantly predicted both by IUD symptom severity at t1 and procrastination at t1. However, procrastination at t2 was predicted only by procrastination at t1 but not by IUD symptom severity at t1. Conclusions: We could not find a reciprocal relationship between procrastination and IUD symptom severity. Procrastination appears to be a causal risk factor for IUDs, but not a consequence. As a modifiable risk factor, procrastination is a promising starting point for preventive and therapeutic interventions for IUDs.},

	abstract = {The temporal decision model of procrastination has proposed that outcome value and task aversiveness are two separate aspects accounting for procrastination. If true, the human brain is likely to implicate separate neural pathways to mediate the effect of outcome value and task aversiveness on procrastination. Outcome value is plausibly constructed via a hippocampus-based pathway because of the hippocampus’s unique role in episodic prospection. In contrast, task aversiveness might be represented through an amygdala-involved pathway. In the current study, participants underwent fMRI scanning when viewing both tasks and future outcomes, without any experimental instruction imposed. The results revealed that outcome value increased activations in the caudate, and suppressed procrastination through a hippocampus-caudate pathway. In contrast, task aversiveness increased activations in the anterior insula, and increased procrastination via an amygdala–insula pathway. In sum, this study demonstrates that people can incorporate both outcome value and task aversiveness into task valuation to decide whether to procrastinate or not; and it elucidates the separate neural pathways via which this occurs.},

It has done so by putting the human back into economics, by recognizing that people sometimes make mistakes, care about others and are generally not as cold and calculating as economists have traditionally assumed. The results have been exciting and fascinating, and have fundamentally changed the way we look at economic behavior. This textbook introduces all the key results and insights of behavioral economics to a student audience. Ideas such as mental accounting, prospect theory, present bias, inequality aversion and learning are explained in detail. These ideas are also applied in diverse settings such as auctions, stock market crashes, charitable donations and health care, to show why behavioral economics is crucial to understanding the world around us. Consideration is also given to what makes people happy, and how we can potentially nudge people to be happier. This new edition contains expanded and updated coverage of contract theory, bargaining in the family, time and risk, and stochastic reference points, among other topics, to ensure that readers are kept up to speed with this fast-paced field. The companion website is also updated with a range of new questions and worked examples. This book remains the ideal introduction to behavioral economics for advanced undergraduate and graduate students.},

Using this allegorical model, we demonstrate conditions under which continuous, prolonged collection of samples from memory is the optimal policy. Consistent with phenomenological observations from clinical and experimental work, we show that prolonged sampling (i.e., chronic rumination), formalized as needing to sample more evidence before selecting an action, is required when possible negative outcomes increase in magnitude, when states of the world with negative outcomes are a priori more likely, and when samples are more variable than expected. By demonstrating that prolonged sampling may allow for optimal action selection under certain environmental conditions, we show how rumination may be adaptive for solving particular problems.},

A factor analysis of the reasons for procrastination Ss listed in a procrastination assessment scale indicated that the factors Fear of Failure and Aversiveness of the Task accounted for most of the variance. A small but very homogeneous group of Ss endorsed items on the Fear of Failure factor that correlated significantly with self-report measures of depression, irrational cognitions, low self-esteem, delayed study behavior, anxiety, and lack of assertion. A larger and relatively heterogeneous group of Ss reported procrastinating as a result of aversiveness of the task. The Aversiveness of the Task factor correlated significantly with depression, irrational cognitions, low self-esteem, and delayed study behavior. Results indicate that procrastination is not solely a deficit in study habits or time management, but involves a complex interaction of behavioral, cognitive, and affective components.

These complexities are illustrated with case studies that highlight the role of negative self-views and associated deficits in self-regulation. Themes explored in the papers include the role of cognitive factors in dysfunctional beliefs and automatic thoughts in procrastination, as well as the role of procrastination and deficits in self-regulation related to stress, psychological distress, and physical illness. Another key theme addressed is the usefulness of REBT and cognitive techniques such as mindfulness training in reducing the tendency to procrastinate.},

	abstract = {Objective: The anxiety and depressive disorders exhibit high levels of lifetime comorbidity with one another. The authors examined how genetic and environmental factors shared by the personality trait neuroticism and seven internalizing disorders may help explain this comorbidity. Method: Lifetime major depression, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, agoraphobia, social phobia, animal phobia, situational phobia, and neuroticism were assessed in over 9,000 twins from male-male, female-female, and opposite-sex pairs through structured diagnostic interviews. Multivariate structural equation models were used to decompose the correlations between these phenotypes into genetic and environmental components, allowing for sex-specific factors. Results: Genetic factors shared with neuroticism accounted for between one-third and one-half of the genetic risk across the internalizing disorders. When nonsignificant gender differences were removed from the models, the genetic correlations between neuroticism and each disorder were high, while individual-specific environmental correlations were substantially lower. In addition, the authors could identify a neuroticism-independent genetic factor that significantly increased risk for major depression, generalized anxiety disorder, and panic disorder. Conclusions: There is substantial, but not complete, overlap between the genetic factors that influence individual variation in neuroticism and those that increase liability across the internalizing disorders, helping to explain the high rates of comorbidity among the latter. This may have important implications for identifying the susceptibility genes for these conditions.},

The construct of active procrastination has a high potential to expand the time management literature and is likely to be adopted by researchers in multiple areas of psychology. To facilitate the research on this new construct and its further integration into the literature, the authors developed and validated a new, expanded measure of active procrastination that reliably assesses its four dimensions. Using this new measure of active procrastination, they further examined its nomological network.

There is also little if any research to date examining whether coping strategies might explain the procrastination–stress relationship. The current research aimed to address these issues by integrating current research on procrastination and coping with our own data into a first meta–analysis of the associations of procrastination with adaptive and maladaptive coping and then testing the potential role of coping for understanding the procrastination–stress relationship. In Study 1, a literature search yielded five published papers and three theses, which were supplemented by seven unpublished data sets comprising 15 samples (N = 4357). Meta–analyses revealed that procrastination was positively associated with maladaptive coping (average r = .31) and negatively associated with adaptive coping (average r = −.24). In Study 2, a meta–analysis of the indirect effects through coping across four samples revealed that the average indirect effects for maladaptive but not adaptive coping explained the link between procrastination and stress. These findings expand the nomological network of procrastination and highlight the role of maladaptive coping for understanding procrastinators‘ stress.

To replicate and extend previous findings 254 adults recruited from the community and the Internet completed self-report measures of procrastination, health, stress, wellness and household safety behaviours. Consistent with previous work, procrastination was associated with higher stress, more acute health problems, and the practice of fewer wellness behaviours. Procrastinators also reported fewer household safety behaviours, and less frequent dental and medical check-ups. The structural equation modeling analyses revealed that stress fully mediated the procrastination-health relationship, but health behaviours did not when the combined effect with stress was considered. These findings suggest that in addition to hindering a variety of health-related behaviours, procrastination may confer additional risk for increased stress, and consequently more health problems.

Recently, some authors argued that for some students, purposefully delaying tasks might be a beneficial strategy that is positively related with desired outcomes. To measure purposeful delay, the Active Procrastination Scale (APS), developed by Choi and Moran (2009), discriminates between four subcomponents (i.e., outcome satisfaction, preference for pressure, intentional decision and ability to meet deadlines). The objective of the present study is threefold: (1) to corroborate the factor structure of the original APS instrument; (2) to empirically examine whether purposeful delay is associated with better achievement; and (3) to identify a subpopulation of students for whom purposefully delaying tasks is an effective strategy. Using a large sample of 1605 science and engineering students, exploratory factor analysis (EFA) supported a three-factor rather than a four-factor structure of the APS. Furthermore, results of the regression analyses showed no evidence for the beneficial effect of purposeful delay on student achievement. Finally, we were unable to identify a particular type of student for whom purposefully delaying tasks resulted in increased achievement. Critical considerations on the construct validity of the APS are discussed in greater detail.},
